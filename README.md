# wot2prom

A simple prototype of a [Web of Things](http://webofthings.org/) to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) gateway.

The goal is to be able to in a simple way scrape one or many Web of Things devices on the network and collect their data. You can then configure [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) or similar to graph the data from gathered by Prometheus.
